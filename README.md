# hello-world
My name is Sarah.  I am very new to writing code.  In a couple weeks I will be starting an HTML and a C++ class at an online university.  I hope to use this website to practice writing code and eventually to use as a way to come up with my own projects to show to potential employers to find my first developer job.
